-----Description-----
- This project is a purely front-end version of an idea that we had for student delivery services at Poly. This was created by three students, two with no previous knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript and one with some knowledge. We learned how to use GitHub to share a repository with pull requests and branches, and we also learned how to create a project in CodePen to see our live edits. We all learned the three languages with FreeCodeCamp.
- The index.html file describes the process of adding a row of information to the user and contains a start button linking to the directory.html page.
- The directory.html file contains a table filled with informaiton and example table data, along with a form where users can input their information to be displayed in the table. Every time the Submit button is pressed, the input text fields are cleared, and the information in the input text fields are appended to a new row under their corresponding headers.
- All of the styling is contained in the styles.css file and referred to in both the html files.
- The Javascript code is contained in each individual file under the <script></script> heading. There is also a jQuery file in the zip file package so that the code can run jQuery to add rows to the table in directory.html dynamically.

-----Installation-----
- Download the zip file containing all of the files. Open index.html in a browser, and you will be able to access directory.html from there.

-----Further recommendations for this project advancement-----
- This page clears on refresh because we do not use any servers to store the data. Cookies would be a short-term solution for a person using a single browser and returning to it multiple times, but it only stores information on the client side. Adding back-end code and creating a server to store this info would be crucial to letting this website become usable for people on multiple devices and networks. 
- The website is not completely dynamic, especially as a mobile site. Creating a mobile version of the website would make the website more usable for mobile users.
- The website is consisted of HTML and CSS files. We would recommend converting the website to an iOS application if this idea becomes more feasible in the future so that more students will use the application.
